It handles support requests submitted from external sources, such as customers.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The other CRM support management option is an internal help desk for company employees. You can enable both features simultaneously, but this guide focuses solely on the external NetSuite case management system.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <h2>General Setup</h2> <p><br></p> <h3>Enable Company Features</h3> <p><br></p> <p>You must enable a few company features to use the NetSuite Case Management System.</p> <p><br></p> <ol> <li>Navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Company &gt; Enable Features &gt; CRM Tab</em>. Under Basic Features, enable <strong>Customer Support and Service</strong>.</li> </ol> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-1.jpg" alt="An image showing General NetSuite Case Management Setup." height="116" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <ol> <li>Under Support, enable the following based on your business needs:</li> </ol> <ul> <li><strong> Email Case Capture </strong></li> <li><strong> Automated Case Escalation </strong></li> <li><strong> Knowledge Base </strong> (if you want to publish support cases)</li> <li><strong> Help Desk </strong> (for internal help/support cases)</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-2.jpg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to enable company features in NetSuite." height="424" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="936"></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p>Now, you can customize the NetSuite Case Management system.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <h2>Setup Tasks</h2> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Statuses</h3> <p><br></p> <p>NetSuite’s pre-configured case statuses help find cases and track their progress. You can even edit them to better suit your business. These statuses are:</p> <p><br></p> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Not Started</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle;">In-Progress</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Escalated</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Re-Opened</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Closed</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p>To find this list, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Statuses</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You can also create a new status by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Statuses &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-3.jpg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to create a new case status in NetSuite." height="314" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Priorities</h3> <p><br></p> <p>True to its name, case priorities organize case management by priority status. NetSuite provides the following pre-configured case priorities.</p> <p><br></p> <ul> <li>High</li> <li>Medium</li> <li>Low</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p>To find the list, navigate to<em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Priorities</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Or create new priorities by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Priorities &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-4.png" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to create a case priority in NetSuite." height="311" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Types</h3> <p><br></p> <p>Case types categorize each case by issue. NetSuite Case Management provides three pre-configured types:</p> <p><br></p> <ul> <li>Question</li> <li>Concern</li> <li>Problem</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p>Businesses can use them for reporting purposes and support organization. For instance, support representatives can be assigned to certain case types based on knowledge or business needs. To find them, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Types. </em></p> <p><br></p> <p>You can create new case types by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Types &gt; New. </em></p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-5.jpg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to create new case types in NetSuite." height="271" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Origin Types</h3> <p><br></p> <p>Case origin types offer details on how a case was submitted. NetSuite Case Management provides four pre-configured origins.</p> <p><br></p> <ul> <li>Web</li> <li>E-mail</li> <li>Phone</li> <li>Other</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Find them by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Origin Types</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Create a new case origin type by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Origin Types &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-6.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to create new case origin types in NetSuite." height="250" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Issues</h3> <p><br></p> <p>Companies generally offer support for goods and services and can use case issues to record intangible requests.</p> <p><br></p> <p>For example, a company may offer support for an item and list installation or repair as the issue. NetSuite doesn’t offer pre-configured case issues, but you can create your own by navigating to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Issues &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-7.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to create new case issues in NetSuite." height="271" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <h2>Case Management Setup</h2> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Profiles</h3> <p><br></p> <p>You can create multiple case profiles to streamline the support management process. Think of your case profile as a team of individuals handling specific business subsets.</p> <p><br></p> <p>However, note that each case profile operates independently. For example, suppose you create a specific template with branding in one profile. That branding isn’t automatically applied to all profiles.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To create a case profile, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Profiles &gt; New</em>. Fill out the following fields on the <strong> General</strong> subtab.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-8.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to create case profiles in NetSuite." height="482" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1078"></p> <p><br></p> <p>As you can see, each case profile has options to assign an email address and filter by a subsidiary.</p> <p><br></p> <p>You must also make two mandatory selections so customers can submit cases online: <strong>Anonymous Customer - Online Form </strong>and <strong> Anonymous Customer - Inbound E-mail</strong>. NetSuite Case Management uses these settings if no pre-existing customer is found in the system when a case is submitted. You can select from the dropdown lists or create your own options.</p> <p><br></p> <h3>Notifications Subtab</h3> <p><br></p> <p>You can select templates for certain email notifications. These templates come pre-built but can be further customized to streamline your support management process.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-9.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to select templates for NetSuite email notifications." height="418" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="837"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Case Rules</h3> <p><br></p> <p>NetSuite Case Management allows users to build rules that automate case assignments to specific support groups or representatives. Case rules are assigned to case territories and based on native and custom fields.</p> <p><br></p> <p>You must create a case rule before you create a territory. NetSuite does not provide any pre-built case rules.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To view existing case rules, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Rules</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To create a new case rule, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Rules &gt; New</em>. You will see a list of all case rule fields you can use.</p> <p><br></p> <p>This example shows the fields you complete to create a case rule for states.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-10.png" alt="This screenshot shows how to create new case rules in NetSuite." height="330" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1326"></p> <p><br></p> <p>You can name your rule and select the states and criteria it applies to. Once this rule is created and saved, you can assign it to a territory and specific support representatives or groups.</p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3> <h3>Case Territories</h3> <h3><br></h3> <p>Case territories allow users to assign rule sets to specific support groups or individual representatives. To view your current case territories, navigate to <em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Territories</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-11.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to view case territories in NetSuite." height="232" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <p>NetSuite Case Management also includes a territory called <strong> Default Round-Robin</strong>. This territory is a catch-all feature. For example, suppose a case comes through that doesn’t match any rules. In that instance, the system will assign it based on the <strong>Default Round-Robin </strong>rule.</p> <p><br></p> <p>You can go into the rule and assign a specific support representative or group to it. Yet, suppose you don’t choose an assignment within the rule. In that instance, any cases that fall outside your territories or rules will sit in the case queue, waiting to be assigned.</p> <p><br></p> <p>You can assign someone to the <strong>Default Round-Robin </strong>rule by simply editing it.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-12.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows the Default Round-Robin rule in NetSuite." height="400" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <p>To create a new case territory, navigate to<em> Setup &gt; Support &gt; Case Territories &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-13.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to create new case territories in NetSuite." height="501" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <p>Name your case territory, and then configure the rule definitions and support assignments applied to it. Select a rule definition from a list of previously created rules. Then, under the <strong>Support Assignment</strong> subtab, select the individuals or group assigned to this territory.</p> <p><br></p> <h3>Escalation Rules</h3> <h3><br></h3> <p>Case escalation rules help automate case assignments. For example, you can escalate certain cases based on case types, priority, etc. The escalation rules and escalation assignments are set up like rules and territories.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To create a case escalation rule, navigate to <em>Setup &gt; Support &gt; Escalation Rules &gt; New</em>. Then, you will see a list of fields upon which you can base your escalation rule.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-14.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows how to create an escalation rule in NetSuite." height="339" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="1430"></p> <p><br></p> <p>After creating a case escalation rule, assign it to a group or individuals. Navigate to <em>Setup &gt; Support &gt; Manage Escalation Assignments &gt; New</em>.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-15.jpg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to manage a case escalation rule in NetSuite." height="296" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="936"></p> <p><br></p> <h3>Support Preferences</h3> <p><br></p> <p>Users can customize many preferences within the NetSuite Case Management system. Preferences include:</p> <p><br></p> <ul> <li>General</li> <li>Notifications</li> <li>External</li> <li>Inbound Email</li> <li>Ordering</li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p>You can also enable or disable them based on company use cases. However, remember to review these cases before your support management system goes live.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Navigate to <em>Setup &gt; Support &gt; Support Preferences. </em></p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-16.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows where to find Support Preferences in NetSuite." height="178" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="936"></p> <p><br></p> <h3><br></h3> <h3><br></h3> <h3>Employee Features</h3> <p><br></p> <p>After configuring all features, preferences, and setup, designate specific employees as support representatives. Otherwise, your team members can’t work cases and utilize all the features offered.</p> <p><br></p> <p>To designate support representatives, locate the employee record for each staff member on the support management team. Then, check the <strong>Support Rep</strong> box on the record.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <h3>Item Features</h3> <p><br></p> <p>Check the <strong>Offer Support</strong> box to select specific items on support cases. You will find it under the <strong> Preferences</strong> subtab on the item record.</p> <p><br></p> <p><img src="https://irp.cdn-website.com/2287385d/dms3rep/multi/NetSuite-Case-Management-18.jpg" alt="This screenshot shows where to the Offer Support box is in NetSuite." height="162" style="display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 50px 0px;" width="936"></p> <h2>Maximize NetSuite and Thrive!</h2> <p><br></p> <p>A properly managed NetSuite CRM streamlines your support process and provides customers with fast service that earns their loyalty.
